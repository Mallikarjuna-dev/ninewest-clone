# NINE_WEST

Basically We have built the E-Commerce Website using pure HTMl, CSS and JavaScript Tool only. We have created the Clone website of NineWest.com. out Team Name is "Team- NINEWEST" and we are 6 members but only 2 people worked on it Rishabh Gupta and Sharan M.
There are Different Parts of the Website like: 
  1. Index Page 
  2. Product's Page 
  3. Product Detail Page 
  4. SignIn / SignUp 
  5. Shopping Bag Page 
  6. Information Page 
  7. Shipping Page
  8. Payment Page

We have Created this clone Website by using Media Queries which make our project Responsive. Our Main motive of clonning the NineWest.com was that to create proper functionality and its designing like: 
  i) Local Storage : Which was very helpful to manage lot of data 
  ii) Async JS: Which helped us to show the slidshow and timers 
  iii) Hover Effect: styling most of the buttons, text and images.

CONCLUSION : Yes we agree that there might be some places where things are static but yes in these 7 days we have done our best and completed how much was needed. And one thing I would like to add that teamwork is something which teaches you various things, if one stucks like for example in presentation then another comes forward and handle that situation. So, this was all from our side.
